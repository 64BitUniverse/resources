          <li>Newer AMD GPUs were not properly detected</li>
          <li>The counting for multiple GPUs started at 0</li>
          <li>bash was recognized as an application if there was a detected .desktop file using bash to start the app</li>
          <li>‚Äúsimple-framebuffers‚Äù were recognized as GPU</li>
          <li>Displayed stock speed instead of overclocked speed for RAM using AMD EXPO or Intel XMP</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

          <li>GPU usage (including video encoder, video decoder and VRAM usage) is now tracked per-process</li>
          <li>The amount of datapoints in graphs is now configurable</li>
          <li>A grid can now be displayed for graphs</li>

          <li>Resources needs less time to load after launch</li>
          <li>Resources‚Äô companion process ‚Äúresources-processes‚Äù is now launched once to run for as long as Resources itself is running, rather than being launched on every refresh</li>
          <li>Better recognition of Chromium-based applications and their many processes</li>
          <li>AMD GPUs have a more precise name in the titlebar</li>
